This project will require me to make a terminal program that accepts input and allows the game to be played


I think the program should be more of a useful one. 
I want it to take scores, place them in a csv file and if i can make a graph.

###Find tools that are for statistical analysis
first i need to experiment with writing to a csv to see how i can do it better, and how to display the information 


python statistics will be what i need to use

look into making a program that print out a graph using the | character
