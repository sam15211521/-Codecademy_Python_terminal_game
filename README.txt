This project will require me to make a terminal program that accepts input and allows the game to be played


I think the program should be more of a useful one. 
I want it to take scores, place them in a csv file and if i can make a graph.

###Find tools that are for statistical analysis
first i need to experiment with writing to a csv to see how i can do it better, and how to display the information 


python statistics will be what i need to use

look into making a program that print out a graph using the | characer




here are a list of functions i need for this to work:

1. graphing function   x   1.0 is done

2. sorting function to sort data into proper areas

3. adding function that fins the sum of all the data

4. counting function that shows the amount of entries there are
	a. also keeps track of how many of each type there are using a dictionary 

5. function that finds the mean 

6. function that finds the mode

7. function that finds the median

8. funciton that finds the standard deviation

9. * function that puts data into a csv file

10. * function that interacts with user 'probably a class'

11. a class that represents data
